title: "Github on your Server -> Gitlab rocks!"

<b>Note</b>: This is an old article I had one my old wordpress server.

I really love Github. It's just awesome, the stuff you can do. 

I always envied that and tried to fill that gap by using redmine, which is okay. Nevertheless is reminds me of a combination of sourceforge webpages and trac.

I always felt the approach of Github was to focus on the user and not on the project.

In redmine, sourceforge, as others, you create a project and link users to it. On Github it is at an opposite way. The user can create as many projects as they please and manage them. They can join to groups and work on something or fork.

Anyways, now let's try Gitlab. Gitlab provides a solution that is like Github but it's a piece of software you can put on your server running Nginx-Webserver. The code is very maintained, with Ubuntu pretty easy to install.

The advantage is that you have fully control over your stuff and don't need to pay for commercial support. Here you can create your private repositories and protect them. You shouldn't do that though if it is meant to be opensource, you know... :-)

Look at these instructions:

Wow, this looks easy and nicely explained, but this should be only be done, if you have a server with nothing else on it. Apache, if  installed or something similar will bite you. So if you install this one I'd rather follow these instructions:

Yeah, no apache instructions on that site. Look, don't use apache or if you need it for something else, tell nginx to use another port. That works very good for me. With link indicated below you can teach those both webservers to coexist peacefully:

So far I can tell with those problems, I really got my server working on some minutes. With redmine and the git plugins I needed much more time and to do a lot of more stuff.

I think redmine has more features, but I have to say I'm more interested in the power of git rather than Gantt Diagrams. At work I didn't see anyone using that thingys, but well it's a way to manage yourself. I think we don't need on a webplatform.

I feel gitlab like github as well are distraction free. So try it out and give the developers credit for their hard work!

Btw. Commander Genius source code is hosted on Github:
