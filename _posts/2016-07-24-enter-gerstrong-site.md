Hey, my first blog with this technology. Already liking this generator thing of static sites. Jekyll is really nice [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for that. It really focuses on content rather than HTML design clutter.

This may have started lazily just to see what else can be done with Github, but I'm starting to think using Jekyll for other sites we have. This is very practical!

I have some blogs of an old site. I might upload those later. Stay tuned!

Special thanks to [jmcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for his great tutorial!
